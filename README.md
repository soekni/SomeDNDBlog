# Quartz v4 Blog with giscus

My personal Quartz v4 configuration with giscus integrated. Original repo found [here](https://github.com/rickliujh/techblog).

## Customization

- added RecentNotes function
- slightly better mobile view (see quartz.layout.ts for details)

## Roadmap

- Leaflet-Support/OG-Graph Support
- custom theme integration
- custom layout options (image alignment, callout blocks etc.)
